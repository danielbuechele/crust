        If the rotary dial accidentally unscrews completely on a very coarse
        setting, reassembly is easy and straightforward. In this case, make sure
        not to remove the knob (A); instead, turn it upside down so that you are

        If the bottom washer becomes loose and falls out during disassembly or

        the mill housing.
