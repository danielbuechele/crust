        outcome of your dishes. This guide will help you understand the
        different types of salt available, what to look for when buying salt for
        a manual grinder, and how to store it for optimal freshness.

      <h2>Quality Indicators to Consider</h2>

      <h3>Purity</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Look For:</strong> Salt that is free from additives such as
          anti-caking agents or iodine, especially if you want the purest
          flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Additives can alter the taste and
          texture of the salt when ground.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Origin</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Best Regions:</strong> Himalayan salt from Pakistan, Fleur de
          Sel from France, sea salts from the Mediterranean.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The origin can influence the mineral
          content and flavor profile of the salt.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Size and Uniformity</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Larger Crystals:</strong> Better suited for grinding, as they
          provide a consistent grind size.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Uniformity:</strong> Ensures even grinding and seasoning.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Organic and Sustainably Sourced</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Benefits:</strong> Ensures the salt is free from pollutants
          and harvested using environmentally friendly methods.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Certification:</strong> Look for organic or Fair Trade labels
          if sustainability is a priority.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Storing Salt</h2>

      <h3>Airtight Containers</h3>
      <p>
        Keep salt in airtight containers to prevent clumping and maintain its
        flavor.
      </p>
      <h3>Cool, Dry Place</h3>
      <p>
        Store away from moisture and heat, as salt can absorb odors and
        humidity.
      </p>
      <h3>Whole vs. Pre-Ground</h3>
      <p>
        Whole crystals retain their potency longer; grind just before use for
        the freshest flavor.
      </p>
      <h3>Avoiding Clumps</h3>
      <p>
        Add a few grains of uncooked rice to the container to absorb moisture
        and prevent clumping.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
